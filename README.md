## Automatic Portfolio Generator
The automatic portfolio generator takes up job details from the client such 
as the profession,skils,achievents,different kinds of works from the user 
to create a catchy portfolio using the three js library of webgl api. It's used to render
high performance interactive 3D graphics in the person's portfolio website.
The client is provided with a number of choices for the templates to choose 
a design of his liking for his portfolio website.
Here we have created a sample portfolio website for a client who is a toymaker.
The idea is still in its early stages of development as we have just demonstrated 
a sample portfolio of a client .
